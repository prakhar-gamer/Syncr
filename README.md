# Syncr

A Google classroom todo list that uses Sellium to scrape tasks, and also scrapes any attatchments with the assignment and uses that to give a time Estimation for the Task
 # How does it work?
 This task scraper uses kotlin completly, and uses Sellium to scrape the tasks from google classroom. For this too work, it uses a premade google account with all the cookies and login set and access the website to get a list of tasks from missing and assigned assignments from only specific classes.

 Then if the user chooses too, you can request a time estimation. This finds, downloads, and upload it to a Gemini 2.5 Flash, and gives you a time estimation on the task you require.

# Requirements
This does require having a google classroom, and having a premade dedicated chrome profile with everything setup. Also Requires a Gemini API Key, and basic Kotlin & Sellium knowledge to setup it up correctly (Better UI and User Settings in v2!!!) 

# Why?
I really hate google classroom, and this project right now seems pretty useless, but for me this allows the future of integration with obsidion/notion. As a busy student, being able to have estimated time for each assignment realy helps with planning, and was a great way to learn kotlin too.

# This is Rough v1 For Dummies Hackclub!
Hopefully v2 sooooooonn!
